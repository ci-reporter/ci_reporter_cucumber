## Supported versions

The latest release of Cucumber 1.3 is supported.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ci_reporter_cucumber'
```

And then install it:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Require the reporter in your Rakefile, and ensure that
`ci:setup:cucumber` is a dependency of your Cucumber task:

```ruby
require 'ci/reporter/rake/cucumber'

# ...
# Rake code that creates a task called `:cucumber`
# ...

task :cucumber => 'ci:setup:cucumber'
```

### Advanced usage

If you want to treat `undefined` and `pending` steps as failures (instead of skipping them), set the `CI_PENDING_IS_FAILURE` environment variable to `true`.

Refer to the shared [documentation][ci] for details on setting up
CI::Reporter.

### Spinach

If you use both Cucumber and Spinach, you are likely to see strange
errors due to `gherkin` and `gherkin-ruby` both being loaded. Choose
only one of these frameworks.
